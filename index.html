    <ul>
        <li>Control the orange snake's movement with the arrow keys.</li>
        <li>Collide with as many green food pellets as you can without colliding with a wall or with the snake's body.</li>
        <li>Pellets make your snake grow. The game ends when you collide with a wall or the snake, and your score is
            based on the length of the snake at game's end.</li>
        <li>The game is in solitaire mode by default, but can be switched to competitive mode via the toggle above.</li>
        <li>A second player can control the blue snake with the WASD keys.</li>
        <li>In competitive mode, the game ends when either snake experiences a collision with a wall, with the other
            snake, or with themselves.</li>
    </ul>
